# OpenDigitizer

Generic Digitizer Framework based on OpenCMW

Integration of time-domain digitizers based upon and using the OpenCMW and GNU Radio frameworks, notably the
operational full-vertical stack integration of the existing digitizer infrastructure and generic digitizer
graphical user interface [1-5]. These and other systems based upon them shall provide generic
monitoring and first-line diagnostics capabilities for accelerator-related devices in order to support
equipment experts, operation, and FAIR users in their development of top-level measurement and control systems.
